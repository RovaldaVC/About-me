I feel like I'm having a progress. to make this project, I used Excalidraw and thought about what I'm making; so it was so easier to manage time for making it (not like the last project which was so hard to handle)
for this project I'm going to add Javascript and Python (backend) because I couldnt do so in the last project; it was so hard for me. I hope I will get used to Javascript and flask.
